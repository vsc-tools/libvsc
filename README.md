# libvsc

libvsc provides an object-oriented framework for generating 
constrained-random data and capturing data-centric coverage. libvsc
is used as a building block for implementing constrained-random
stimulus-generation in various environments.

libvsc supports phased solving, where different portions of a
larger constraint problem are incrementally resolved.
